# Analyzing-Police-Activities
This repositroy contains two csv files as data set and a ipynb file.
In this project,I have explored  the Stanford Open Policing Project datasets and analyze the impact of gender on police behavior. During this, I cleaned the messy data, created visualizations, combined and reshaped datasets, and manipulated time series data with the help of various python libraries.
